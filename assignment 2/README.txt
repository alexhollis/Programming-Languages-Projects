:[Compiling]:
To compile either click and open the file with SWI in Windows, or open the SWI console, and use the following statement:

?- ['funny_sentences.pl'].

This will compile the dictionary file.



:[Executing]:

To execute the code, call the create sentence function as follows:

?- create_sentence(A,B,C,D,E).

The sentences will be rapidly generated in roughly 2-5 seconds depending on pc speed, and usage. 

You may then scroll up and down to read the interesting creations!


:[Testing Environment]:

In this assignment I used the following setup:

OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

SWI: Version 7.2.3 64-bit

Editor: Notepad++
