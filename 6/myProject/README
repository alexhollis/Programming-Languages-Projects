Authors: Ronnie Brewer, Brian Mauldin, Alex Hollis, Supriya Thapa



[HOW TO COMPILE]

1. To compile the scala program, you will use scalac on the "PageRankMainApp.scala" code, as follows: '  $ scalac PageRankMainApp.scala '



[HOW TO EXECUTE]

1. Once the code has been compiled, you will see 2 new class files in the same directory PageRankMainApp$.class and PageRankMainApp.class

2. To run the program, just call scala on PageRankMainApp as follows:   '$ scala PageRankMainApp '

3. The code will now execute and output the ranks for each node of the Wikipedia Graph.
